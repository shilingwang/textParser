Epigenetics is defined as heritable traits that are not linked to changes in the DNA sequence; however, in broader terms, epige-netics is used to describe the mechanisms by which chromatinassociated proteins and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of 
histones regulate transcription. Although all cells within an organism 
contain the same DNA, epigenetic regulators and transcription factors 
organize the genome into accessible and closed regions, which ensure 
the correct transcriptional program in a given cell type. Thus, epigenetic 
regulation is important for maintaining cell identity and is implicated in 
fundamental processes such as proliferation, development, differentiation and genome integrity. Epigenetic gene regulation can be mediated 
through DNA methylation, nucleosome remodelling, exchange of histone variants and PTMs of the histones (Box 1). Histones can be modified at specific amino acids with a diverse set of chemical modifications, 
such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination or 
SUMOylation1,2. Research in the past decade has led to a better understanding of the significance of these PTMs. In particular, this progress 
has been achieved through the identification of chromatin-associated 
proteins that catalyse, recognize and remove the specific modification 
(Box 1), the generation of high affinity antibodies specific for the PTM, 
genome-wide location analysis and genetic studies. 
Deregulation of epigenetic control is a common feature of a number 
of diseases, including brain disorders and cancer3. The involvement 
of DNA methylation in cancer has been appreciated for a number of 
years, and the approval of the first drugs targeting DNA methylation 
is a hallmark for epigenetic-based therapies. The two approved drugs, 
azacitidine (5-azacytidine) and decitabine (5-aza-2ʹ-deoxycytidine), are 
nucleoside analogues and irreversible inhibitors of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3. They are currently used 
as first-line treatments for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome4,5. 
Shortly after the approval of the two DNA methylation inhibitors, the 
two histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic 
acid (SAHA) and romidepsin (depsipeptide or FK228) were approved 
for the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma6,7. Although 
the introduction of these drugs in the clinic has been a tremendous success for the field, a number of scientific challenges remain. Despite many 
years of research, we do not understand exactly how and why these 
drugs work. For HDAC inhibitors, acetylation is in general increased 
following drug treatment; however, data demonstrating a correlation 
between HDAC activity and therapeutic index is still lacking. Similarly, 
so far there is no established gene expression signature or profile that 
can predict whether a patient will benefit from the use of HDAC inhibitors. The picture is very similar for DNMT inhibitors. Although these 
molecularly targeted drugs have the potential to revert the epigenetic 
modification and have been shown to lead to global hypomethylation, 
we do not know their precise mechanism of action. For both classes of 
drug, the lack of reliable molecular biomarkers for predicting either 
clinical activity or resistance is a serious drawback, limiting clinicians’ 
ability to achieve the vision of ‘personalized medicine’. Despite a large 
number of clinical trials, the use of the four drugs is so far limited to 
specific haematological cancers.
Recently, the use of next-generation sequencing technologies on DNA 
isolated from primary tumours has revealed a high frequency of somatic 
mutations in genes coding for chromatin-associated proteins that are 
known to regulate DNA methylation patterns, histone PTMs and chromatin remodelling (see ref. 8 for a review). Strikingly, the discovery that 
patients with leukaemia often have mutations in genes such as TET2, 
IDH1, IDH2 and DNMT3A, which are all involved in regulating DNA 
methylation patterns, might provide insight into why patients with leukaemia show a significant response to DNA methylation inhibitors, 
and could hold promise for future patient stratification strategies. In 
fact, the lack of genetic data to support the role of chromatin-associated 
proteins in cancer has been a major obstacle for the development of 
patient-specific targeted therapies. This has drastically changed with the 
recent findings that chromatin-associated proteins often show aberrant 
expression in cancer as a result of translocations or genetic amplifications, and by the discovery that they carry specific somatic mutations. 
In this Review, we will focus on the recent advances made by the 
scientific and pharmaceutical communities to develop highly potent 
and specific inhibitors to chromatin-associated proteins (Table 1). 
These represent several new classes of therapeutic targets and, as we 
will exemplify, recent results have shown the feasibility of developing specific inhibitors to histone methyltransferases (HMTs), histone 
demethylases and domains required for the binding of protein complexes to specific histone modifications. This is a very exciting time for 
the field, in which the combination of knowledge regarding the role 
of chromatin-associated proteins in disease and the development of 
potential new classes of epigenetic drugs will hopefully lead to molecularly targeted and lower toxicity therapies with a clear genetic marker 
or markers for patient stratification. 
A plethora of groundbreaking studies have demonstrated the importance of chromatin-associated proteins and posttranslational modifications of histones, proteins and DNA (so-called epigenetic modifications) for transcriptional control 
and normal development. Disruption of epigenetic control is a frequent event in disease, and the first epigenetic-based 
therapies for cancer treatment have been approved. A generation of new classes of potent and specific inhibitors for several 
chromatin-associated proteins have shown promise in preclinical trials. Although the biology of epigenetic regulation is 
complex, new inhibitors such as these will hopefully be of clinical use in the coming years.

Targeting histone methyltransferases
An association between histone hypermethylation, transcriptional regulation and the cancer phenotype has spurred efforts to develop specific, 
small molecule inhibitors of the methyltransferase enzymes involved in 
histone lysine and arginine methylation. The family of HMTs (or more 
accurately, protein methyltransferases; that is, protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) and protein lysine methyltransferases (KMTs)) 
encompasses over 60 different proteins that sequentially transfer a methyl 
group from the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the terminal 
amine of specific substrate lysine and/or arginine residues. With the notable exception of the HMT DOT1L (see later), the catalytic transfer of a 
methyl group from SAM occurs within a conserved SET domain, which 
accommodates the cofactor and peptide substrates in a conformation conducive for an SN2 transfer reaction generating S-adenosylhomocysteine 
(SAH) and the methylated histone side chain as products (Fig. 1). Detailed 
structural determinations of multiple SET-domain-containing HMTs 
have been carried out to support this mechanistic rationale for the methyl 
transfer event with a detailed analysis of binding modes of cofactor and/or 
peptide substrates to allow the rational design of selective inhibitors. An 
understanding of exactly how the degree of histone lysine methylation 
modulates transcription remains to be attained, but the need for the coordinated recruitment of methylation-sensitive proteins to transcriptional 
complexes offers one plausible hypothesis. Interestingly, the HMTs have 
also been reported9–11 to act on various non-histone protein substrates to 
regulate their functions. However, the relative contributions of the histone 
compared with non-histone action of HMTs are not well understood and 
continue to be an area of active investigation. 
In the context of cancer, the discovery of genetic alterations in HMTs in 
several different tumour types12–14 has undoubtedly attracted much attention and provided additional support for the importance of epigenetic 
deregulation in a disease that is widely considered to be genetically driven. 
In some cases (such as the methyltransferase EZH2, discussed later), heterozygous point mutations in the catalytic SET domain lead to a gain 
of function of the wild-type enzyme15,16, favouring trimethylation and 
the silencing of tumour suppressor genes and/or differentiation-specific 
genes. Similarly, in other cancers (such as, increased expression of NSD2 
in multiple myeloma) chromosomal translocations result in increased 
expression of the methyltransferases, again leading to aberrant transcription and proliferation17. Conversely, lysine methylation induced by the 
HMT DOT1L results in sustained expression of several genes required 
for leukaemogenesis. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors, of for instance 
EZH2 or DOT1L, should be able to reduce or eliminate the site-specific 
lysine methylation introduced by the HMTs and reverse the oncogenic 
state (see later). 
DOT1L
Chromosomal translocations are relatively common in various haematopoietic malignancies and can be associated with aggressive or poorly 
responsive disease. In leukaemia that involves rearrangement of the MLL 
(also known as KMT2A) gene, translocation leads to fusions with more 
than 50 different protein partners including ENL, ELL, AF4 and AF9 
(ref. 18) (Fig. 2a). The resulting fusion complexes recruit DOT1L, which 
specifically methylates the core histone H3 residue lysine 79 (H3K79) 
and contributes to transcriptional activation of HOXA10, MEIS1 and 
other genes required for leukaemia initiation19. DOT1L lacks the SET 
domain that is commonly present in other lysine methyltransferases but 
nonetheless can readily catalyse the transfer of one, two or three methyl 
groups to the ε-NH2 group of H3K79. In a crucial paper from the Armstrong laboratory20, deletion of DOT1L in MLL-rearranged cell lines and 
subsequently in in vivo mouse studies directly demonstrated the role of 
the enzyme not only in introducing the H3K79 methyl mark, leading to 
a concomitant increase in gene expression, but also in the development 
of the leukaemia.
Given the significant role of DOT1L in MLL-rearranged leukaemia, 
inhibitors of its H3K79 methyltransferase activity have been aggressively 
pursued as potential therapeutics. EPZ004777, a SAM-competitive pyrrolopyrimidine derivative (Fig. 2b) was designed21 to mimic both SAM 
and the reaction product SAH while also taking advantage of potential 
hydrophobic interactions available in the binding vicinity. The compound is an extremely potent and remarkably selective SAM-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. In MLL-rearranged cell lines, EPZ004777 
reduces global H3K79me2 levels, blocks the expression of MLL-fusion 
target genes and has antiproliferative activity21. Consistent with a targeted mechanism of action, only cell lines with an MLL gene fusion were 
DNA is wrapped around histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) 
to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are further compacted 
to form condensed chromatin. The compaction of DNA is 
in part regulated through post-translational modifications 
(PTMs) of the histone tails, which protrude from nucleosomes. 
Epigenetic regulators can in popular terms be divided into 
erasers, writers or readers of PTMs. The erasers, such as 
histone deacetylases and histone demethylases, remove 
the PTMs and prepare the histones for other modifications. 
The writers comprise enzymes such as histone acetylases, 
kinases, DNA and histone methyltransferases and ubiquitin 
ligases. The writers catalyse the PTMs on the DNA or the 
proteins, and may impose epigenetic heritability such as 
DNA methylation through copying and maintaining the 
modification. Other modifications, such as histone acetylation, 
respond rapidly to environmental stimuli and are therefore 
more dynamic. Readers of the post-translational modification 
include proteins with specific domains, such as bromo-, 
chromo-, tudor-, MBT-, PWWP-, WD40- and PHD-domains, 
which bind to the specific modification. The readers, which 
are often found in large protein complexes, interpret the 
modification and impose changes in chromatin structure.

sensitive to the DOT1L inhibitor whereas non-rearranged lines remained 
unaffected. Regardless of the measured parameter, the kinetics of cellular 
response to DOT1L inhibition (and other epigenetic drugs reported so 
far) is strikingly distinct to the more rapid response usually seen within a 
few hours with signal transduction modulators (kinase inhibitors) or nonspecific chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, the maximal effect on depletion 
of the methyl mark is typically seen only after 4–5 days of exposure to the 
drug. Similarly, significant transcriptional changes occur after 6–8 days 
and more than 10 days are required to observe an antiproliferative phenotype. Defining and understanding these distinctive characteristics 
have important implications for the development of these agents because 
established measures of biomarker-based pharmacodynamic and/or early 
clinical response may be inappropriate. In addition, prolonged exposure 
to the drug may be required for efficacy, further highlighting the need for 
a selective compound with presumably lower propensity for undesirable 
off-target effects. Encouragingly, in preclinical experiments, EPZ004777 
seemed to be well tolerated when given to mice at efficacious doses21.
Unfortunately, notwithstanding these attractive attributes, poor pharmacokinetics — including a short plasma half-life — requires EPZ004777 
to be administered as a 7 day continuous infusion using surgically 
implanted mini-osmotic pumps. In a preclinical setting, such studies are 
readily conducted but can pose significant challenges in clinical studies 
involving patients with cancer. In an attempt to address these shortcomings, further modifications of the pyrrolopyrimidine core of EPZ004777 
have been investigated22 as an approach to designing second-generation 
DOT1L-targeting drugs. For example, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) has described bromo-deaza-SAH (Fig. 2b) as a convenient 
DOT1L inhibitor, allowing for the generation of X-ray co-crystal structures and hence the rational design of new analogues with improved 
properties23. The recent initiation, by the biotech company Epizyme, of 
clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of the DOT1L inhibitor 
EPZ-5676 (ref. 24) in patients with MLL leukaemia is highly significant 
and represents the first human study of a ‘targeted’ HMT inhibitor.
EZH2
The enzyme EZH2 is the catalytic component of the Polycomb protein 
complex PRC2 and acts as an HMT at H3K27. Importantly, in cell-free 
systems the EZH2 subunit is only catalytically competent when in a 
complex with at least two non-enzymatic partners (EED and SUZ12) 
and moreover in a physiologically relevant, intracellular context, the 
complex is known to contain two additional proteins (AEBP2 in complex with either RBBP4 or RBBP7)25 (Fig. 2c). 
PRC2 maintains the transcriptional repression of a large number 
of genes with key regulatory roles in development and differentiation, 
and PRC2 proteins are required for normal embryonic development25. 
Pioneering studies from the Chinnaiyan lab have shown an association 
between increased levels of both EZH2 and H3K27me3 and poor outcomes in metastatic prostate cancer26. In addition, inactivating mutations 
in UTX, an H3K27 demethylase27,28, are also similarly correlated, suggesting a key role for H3K27 hypermethylation in prostate cancer. Other studies have revealed a similar relationship between elevated levels of EZH2 
with silencing of EZH2 target genes and poor prognosis in solid tumours, 
including breast, kidney and lung29–32. More recently, somatic activating 
mutations in the SET domain of EZH2 have been identified in follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), leading to 
increased H3K27me3 (refs 33–35). Taken together, these findings suggest 
that misregulation of H3K27me3 levels, through EZH2 overexpression 
or point mutations, silences target genes that are important to tumour 
growth and survival and make a compelling case for targeting the enzyme 
therapeutically. Paradoxically, however, inactivating mutations in EZH2 
have also been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome36, raising the 
potential of a tumour suppressor function for the protein. The role of 
EZH2 and H3K27 methylation in promoting or inhibiting tumorigenesis 
and/or maintenance seems therefore to be context dependent and, based 
on the potential for deleterious effects, suggests caution should be taken 
in developing chronically administered therapeutic inhibitors. Despite 
these potential drawbacks, multiple pharmaceutical and biotech company 
research groups have developed highly potent, selective, small molecule 
inhibitors of EZH2 (refs 37–39), and other investigators have pursued 
equally interesting natural-product-based inhibitors40.
The medicinal chemistry design of HMT inhibitors has sought to take 
advantage of the intrinsic affinity of EZH2 for both SAH (Ki = 7.5 uM) 
and lysine-containing substrate mimetics. Hybrid molecules (such as 
that shown in Fig. 2d) that contain discrete elements of both recognition motifs are modest inhibitors and presumably act as classical bisubstrate inhibitors41. However, the relatively low permeability of these 
highly charged compounds might limit their use in cell-based assays 
and in vivo. By contrast, despite being devoid of direct EZH2 inhibitory activity, the structurally related and widely used 3-deazaneplanocin 
(DZNep; Fig. 2d) has been shown to reactivate indirectly PRC2-silenced 
genes in cancer cell lines by depleting PRC2 subunits42. Unfortunately, 
this activity does not allow for differentiation of selective catalytic inhibition of EZH2 from more global effects of depleting PRC2, including 
loss of scaffolding functions, microRNA binding sites and so on, and 
complicates the interpretation of cellular phenotypes resulting from 
true inhibition of H3K27 methylation43. Ultimately, the use of DZNep 
in studies related to investigating the role of EZH2 inhibition in bioassays should be avoided.
High throughput screening of distinct compound libraries by 
various groups led to the discovery of non-SAM-derived catalytic 
inhibitors of EZH2. Remarkably, all the screens identified compounds with a pyridone amide motif, indicating a crucial molecular recognition role for functionality. Although these molecules do 
not resemble SAM, biochemically they are competitive inhibitors of 
cofactor binding and various three dimensional homology models 
have been proposed to rationalize how they may mimic the interactions of the natural substrate. Ultimately, detailed structural studies 
will be needed to determine unequivocally if both occupy the same 
binding site in EZH2. Despite these uncertainties, extensive chemical 
modification of the hits identified in high throughput screening to 
improve affinity and pharmaceutical properties led to the discovery of analogues37–39 (such as those shown in Fig. 2d), all of which 
were highly potent, selective and bioavailable inhibitors of EZH2 
in biochemical and cellular assays with in vivo antitumour activity 
in germinal-cell DLBCL with activating EZH2 mutations. Remarkably, these compounds show exquisite selectivity for EZH2 inhibition

(more than 10,000-fold) over most other methyltransferases and can 
distinguish from EZH1 inhibition (around 100-fold). One of these 
compounds (EPZ-6438, also known as E7438) has entered human 
clinical trials and several others are likely to follow shortly, allowing 
for an assessment of the therapeutic potential of targeting EZH2 in 
not only lymphoma but also solid tumours with increased levels of 
H3K27me3. In this context, the recent report of the activity of an 
EZH2 inhibitor in a preclinical model of paediatric malignant rhabdoid cancer is notable. A subset of these tumours with inactivated 
SMARCB1 are thought to be dependent on the catalytic activity of 
EZH2, and in xenograft models were shown to be sensitive to treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor, EPZ-6438 (ref. 44). Interestingly, and 
as mentioned above, other solid tumours (for example, prostate and 
breast) have also been associated with drastic upregulation of EZH2 
expression but surprisingly, no convincing data has emerged showing 
activity of catalytic EZH2 inhibitors in these cancers. As with many 
other new potential therapeutics, the safety profile of EZH2 inhibitors 
remains to be fully defined but initial observations in prolonged animal studies suggest that they are well tolerated with little or no overt 
toxicity and EPZ-6438 has been advanced to a phase 1/2 clinical trial 
in patients with advanced solid tumours or with B-cell lymphomas.
Targeting histone demethylases
Previously, methylation was considered to constitute a permanent and 
irreversible histone modification that defined epigenetic programs in 
concert with DNA methylation. However, the discovery of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also known as KDM1A, AOF2, BHC110 and 
KIAA0601) and later the JmjC-domain-containing lysine demethylase 
family has completely changed this view (for reviews, see refs 45, 46). 
LSD1 and its close relative LSD2 (also known as KDM1B and AOF1) 
belong to the superfamily of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxidases (Fig. 3a). The two proteins can catalyse the demethylation of H3K4me2 and H3K4me1, and LSD1 has in addition been 
shown to catalyse the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me1 as well 
as a number of non-histone proteins such as p53, DNMT1 and E2F1. 
The JmjC-domain family
In contrast to the LSD demethylases, the JmjC-domain-containing 
demethylases can also demethylate trimethylated lysines. This catalysis involves an oxidative mechanism requiring iron and 2-oxoglutarate as co-factors and probably occurs through direct hydroxylation of 
the affected methyl group (Fig. 3b)45,46. There are 30 of these JmjCdomain-containing proteins in humans, of which 17 have been shown 
to be active histone lysine demethylases. Several results have associated the histone lysine demethylases with disease, in particular cancer 
and brain disorders. For instance, members of the JMJD2 (also known 
as KDM4) family, which can demethylate H3K9me3 and H3K9me2, 
and H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 have been found to be overexpressed 
in squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer and medulloblastoma47–49. 
Moreover members of the JARID1 (also known as KDM5) family that 
demethylate H3K4me3 and me2 are overexpressed in breast and bladder cancers50,51, and FBXL10 (also known as KDM2B), specific for 
H3K36me3 and me2, is overexpressed in leukaemia52. Somatic mutations and deletions have also been identified in the JmjC-domain-containing demethylases, including the H3K27me3 and me2 demethylase 
UTX (also known as KDM6A) that is found mutated in, for instance, 
multiple myeloma and renal cell carcinoma27,28, and in JARID1C (also 
known as KDM5C) and PHF8 in patients with X-linked mental retardation53,54. These mutations often lead to loss of a functional demethylase, 
and because they may be responsible for the disease phenotype, these 
observations could suggest that the corresponding HMT is a good target 
for drug development. 
Although our understanding of the biological role of the histone 
demethylases in normal development and disease is still relatively 
poor, they are considered to be attractive targets for drug development 
due to their association with disease and their well-defined catalytic 
mechanism. The use of structure-guided design has recently led to the 
first highly potent and selective inhibitors to JmjC-domain containing 
enzymes55. These inhibitors, which are competitive with 2-oxoglutarate and non-competitive with a peptide substrate, are potent inhibitors 
with an half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar 
range, and were shown to be specific for the JMJD3 (also known as 
KDM6B) and UTX H3K27 demethylases. JMJD3 has previously been 
associated with inflammatory responses, and in agreement with this 
a JMJD3 and UTX inhibitor reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by human primary macrophages55. In addition to showing the 
relevance of the catalytic activity of JMJD3 in this process, this study 
provided proof of concept for generating specific JmjC-domain inhibitors. Further proof of concept has been provided by the biotech company EpiTherapeutics, which has developed highly potent inhibitors 
to the JARID1 family (L.-O. Gerlach, personal communication). These 
compounds show specific in vivo target engagement of JARID1B, an 
increase in H3K4me3 levels in treated cells and reduced proliferation of 
cancer cells in a xenograft mouse model (L.-O. Gerlach, personal communication). These proof-of-concept studies provide support for the 
idea that JmjC-domain-containing proteins can be targeted by specific 
compounds, which may have therapeutic applications. 
LSD1
It is likely that the first small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases 
that enter clinical trials will target LSD1 (ref. 56) (Fig. 3c). Several data 
have suggested that LSD1 could be an interesting therapeutic target in 
cancer because of its high-level expression in prostate cancer, undifferentiated neuroblastoma, oestrogen-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer 
and colorectal cancer57–60. Nevertheless, the recent demonstration that 
LSD1 is required for the development and maintenance of acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML) has gained the most attention61,62. Specifically, both 
genetic and pharmacological data have been provided in vitro and in 
animal models showing that LSD1 is required to sustain the expression 
of genes induced by the MLL–AF9 oncoprotein and therefore the maintenance of leukaemia stem cells61. The pharmacological results included 
the use of the general monooxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP)62 
and the TCP-derivative trans-N-((2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methyl)2-phenylcyclopropan-1-amine) — developed by the biotech company

Oryzon Genomics63 (Fig. 3c) — that is more specific and 100-fold more 
potent than TCP61. The inhibition of LSD1 in AML led to increased differentiation followed by apoptosis, and consistent with this an increase 
in expression of differentiation markers (for example, CD11b). The 
inhibition of LSD1 activity was not associated with a global increase 
in H3K4me2; however, some increase in H3K4me2 was observed on 
MLL–AF9 bound genes and genes involved in differentiation61,62. Taken 
together these studies provide proof of concept for LSD1 as a therapeutic 
target in leukaemia; however, the mechanism by which LSD1 contributes to leukaemia is not clear for several reasons. First, LSD1 has been 
found to be part of several chromatin complexes, including the neuronal 
silencer co-repressor of RE1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST; 
also known as RCOR1) and the nucleosome remodelling and histone 
deacetylase NuRD45 (Fig. 3d). These complexes are found throughout 
the genome and have a pleotropic role in transcriptional regulation. 
Second, LSD1 also binds throughout the genome, especially at active 
promoters and enhancers64,65. Third, as mentioned above, LSD1 can 
demethylate H3K9me2 and me1, and H3K4me2 and me1 (Fig. 3d). 
H3K9me2 is normally found associated with repressed chromatin and 
transcriptional silencing, whereas H3K4me2 and me1 are associated with 
active promoters and enhancers. Inhibition of LSD1 activity in AML did 
not lead to any change in H3K9me2, whereas an increase of H3K4me2 
was observed on MLL–AF9 target genes61 and CD11b62. These observations raise several questions. First, if LSD1 is bound throughout the 
genome, why does the inhibition of LSD1 lead to the selective increase 
of H3K4me2 on specific promoters? Second, the expression of MLL–
AF9 target genes is decreased in response to LSD1 inhibition, whereas 
H3K4me2 is increased. This is counterintuitive, because an increase in 
H3K4me2 is normally associated with increased expression of a gene, as 
is the case for CD11b. Therefore, what is the mechanism leading to the 
decreased expression of MLL–AF9 target genes, and how does inhibition 
of LSD1 lead to differentiation and apoptosis? 
Despite the lack of precise mechanistic insight into how LSD1 inhibition can lead to inhibition of leukaemia and prolonged survival of mice, 
the LSD1 inhibitors seem very promising. Oryzon Genomics has reported 
on the further development of a clinical compound, ORY-1001, which is 
more than 1,000 times more potent than TCP and highly selective over 
related enzymes, including LSD2 (ref. 66). The structure of ORY-1001 has 
not been revealed; however, it has been shown to reduce leukaemic stemcell potential, colony formation and to induce differentiation of AML 
cell lines at subnanomolar concentrations63. Moreover, ORY-1001 leads 
to the time/dose-dependent increase of H3K4me2 at LSD1 target genes 
(for example, those that encode CD11b) and induction of differentiation 
markers (T. Maes, personal communication). Oryzon Genomics expects 
to take ORY-1001 into phase I clinical trials later this year. 
Interestingly, the potential use of LSD1 inhibitors is not limited to oncological disease. In fact, the weak LSD1 inhibitor TCP has been used as a 
non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor for the treatment of depression67, and because aberrant activity of the REST–CoREST–LSD complex 
has been implicated in Huntington’s disease68 and LSD1 in herpes infection69 the LSD1 inhibitors may also be useful for these indications.
Targeting bromodomains
Bromodomains comprise a small family of proteins that recognize and 
bind to acetylated lysine residues on histone tails (Fig. 4a). Acting as 
a scaffold for both the assembly of larger, multi-component macromolecular complexes regulating chromatin accessibility and for the 
recruitment of key transcriptional proteins such as RNA polymerase,

bromodomain-containing proteins are considered ‘readers’ of the histone code. The human genome encodes more than 50 bromodomain 
proteins, which can be phylogenetically segregated into eight subfamilies70. Embryonic lethality on knockdown of the genes encoding 
bromodomain containing proteins71 underscores the primary importance of the proteins in basic cell function, but it has also limited our 
better understanding of their role in normal and disease physiology. 
Structurally, bromodomains are made up of a bundle of four alpha 
helices joined by two closely interacting but sequence variable loops 
that form an invaginated, largely hydrophobic pocket for binding to 
the acetylated lysine ligand70.
The current intense interest in therapeutically targeting various 
bromodomains originated in the demonstration by GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK), the SGC and the Bradner lab that the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily (Brd2, Brd3, Brd4 and BrdT) could be targeted by small molecule antagonists72,73. By directly binding to the BET 
proteins, such compounds prevent the interaction of the reader module 
to the acetylated histone thereby preventing assembly of an active gene 
transcriptional complex (Fig. 4a). The ability to disrupt these protein–
protein interactions with drug-like compounds is remarkable and has 
been shown in multiple structural studies67 to be related to the presence 
of well-defined, deep acetyl lysine binding pockets within the BET 
proteins. By applying cell-based, high throughput screening of compound libraries combined with elegant chemoproteomics and a battery 
of structural and biophysical assays, GSK developed compounds that 
were able to inhibit all four BET proteins but with good selectivity over 
other bromodomains. Similarly, the SGC working with the Bradner 
lab developed the widely used JQ1 (Fig. 4b), originating from a patent 
application by Mitsubishi–Tanabe74. Crucially, the free availability of 
these compounds to the research community has drastically accelerated our understanding of the primary mechanism of transcriptional 
regulation and wider chromatin biology. Indeed, the realization that the 
pharmacological effects of BET inhibition could potentially be applied 
to ameliorate diverse disease phenotypes has spurred further rounds 
of compound discovery in pharmaceutical companies.
Early evidence for the potential involvement of BET proteins in cancer was the observation that overexpression of Brd2 in lymphocytes 
induced B-cell lymphomas. Subsequently, French et al. reported that 
chromosomal translocation of the Brd4 gene with the NUT protein 
was the driver for proliferation in the rare but lethal malignancy, NUTmidline carcinoma (NMC)75. Furthermore, reversal of the tumour 
phenotype with BET inhibition not only provided support for the 
underlying mechanism but also illustrated the therapeutic potential 
of BET antagonism. Based on this data, a phase I clinical study of 
the GSK BET inhibitor IBET762 (Fig. 4b) in NMC was initiated in 
March 2012.
Investigation of the anti-proliferative activity of BET inhibitors 
in models of haematological cancer, including AML, Burkitt’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
has revealed perhaps the most exciting facet of bromodomain biology76,77. In these malignancies, BET inhibitors such as JQ1 and the 
more highly bioavailable IBET151 (Fig. 4b) directly silenced MYC 
expression through disruption of BET protein binding at the MYC 
locus. Because the various MYC isoforms are known to be crucial

regulators of cell proliferation and survival and MYC is a potent 
oncogene overexpressed in many cancers, bromodomain antagonism offers, for the first time, an opportunity to target MYC-driven 
oncogenicity. Intriguingly, however, recent reports have shown crucial 
subtleties in the mechanism of BET inhibitor modulation of MYC78. 
Whereas in haematological cancers, BET regulates c-MYC, in neuroblastoma, BET inhibitor effects seem to be manifested through 
silencing of N-MYC, presumably by the same or at least a similar 
mechanism. These results suggest there is potential for a broader spectrum of activity for BET inhibitors beyond NMC and haematological 
malignancies, and ongoing clinical studies with IBET762 now include 
other solid tumours such as N-MYC-amplified lung and colorectal 
cancers. The question of a therapeutic window for BET inhibitors in 
a clinical setting remains to be answered but presumably data from 
animal toxicity studies did not preclude advancing these compounds 
to human trials.
Outside of cancer, BET inhibition has shown striking effects in a 
range of inflammatory disease models, suggesting a central role in 
lymphocyte lineage aetiology. Interestingly, BET inhibition with 
IBET762 attenuated only secondary response genes in macrophages 
with no effect on the primary response elements72. The ability to 
modulate selectively the expression of gene subsets is of significance 
and raises the possibility of further fine-tuning the level of transcriptional activity with selective inhibitors of other bromodomains, which 
could translate to clinical benefits with fewer undesirable side effects. 
In mouse models of sepsis, pretreatment with a BET inhibitor suppressed cytokine expression and protected the animals from lethal 
lipopolysaccharide challenge. In a noteworthy demonstration of activity, administration of the inhibitor even after allergen challenge led to 
survival69. Evidence of the function of other bromodomains (SP110, 
SP140 and SMARCA4) in immune-mediated diseases driven by loss 
of memory T cells and B cells is emerging and limited to tantalizing 
association of bromodomain expression and disease phenotype. It is 
too early to say whether small molecule inhibitors of other bromodomains or methyl-lysine readers can be successfully identified, but 
some promising advances have recently been made with BAZ2B and 
chromodomain proteins associated with brain tumours (Table 1). The 
development and availability of additional specific small molecule 
probes will be needed to help delineate the biology of these proteins.
Perspectives
This is a very exciting and fruitful time for the ‘epigenetics field’ as illustrated by recent discoveries of new classes of enzymes, insight into the 
biological role of chromatin-associated proteins, findings showing that 
somatic mutations in genes coding for chromatin-associated proteins 
are very frequent in cancer and the development of highly potent and 
specific small molecule inhibitors to chromatin-associated proteins that 
show great promise in preclinical trials. Until recently, it was uncertain 
whether it would be technically feasible to generate specific and potent 
inhibitors to the different classes of readers, writers and erasers of the 
histone code. However, as we have discussed in this Review, this has 
indeed been possible for very diverse enzymatic classes, such as the 
HMTs, the two different subclasses of histone demethylases and for the 
non-enzymatic bromodomain-containing proteins. These inhibitors 
are undergoing or will shortly enter human phase I clinical trials for a 
variety of oncology indications albeit initially in rare tumour types or 
haematopoietic malignancies.
A major challenge for a potential expansion of the inhibitors to other 
tumour types will be to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of 
action of the drugs, and therefore of the biology of the target protein. The 
ongoing phase I clinical trials have all been designed based on genetic 
evidence for a role of the targeted protein in the disease (DOT1L and 
LSD1 in AML, EZH2 in DLBCL and IBET in NUT-midline carcinoma). 
Such strong genetic evidence does not currently exist in other tumour 
types; however, the effect of the specific inhibitors on large, ‘omically’ 
well-characterized cell-line panels will hopefully help to identify specific genetic alterations that lead to drug sensitivity. Nonetheless, even 
this approach is unlikely to be straightforward because most chromatinassociated proteins are present in several different multi-component 
complexes that are associated with several thousand genes and loci 
throughout the genome. The biology is therefore complex and, depending on the tissue and the underlying genetic landscape of the cell, the 
chromatin-associated protein could act as an oncogene in one setting 
but be a tumour suppressor in other circumstances. This is illustrated, 
for instance, by EZH2, in which gain-of-function mutations promote 
lymphoid transformation16,33,37,79 and loss-of-function mutations promote myelodysplastic syndrome and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia36,80–83. Similarly, somatic mutations of lysine 27 of H3.3 found 
in paediatric glioblastoma have been shown to inhibit EZH2 activity84. 
The dual roles of EZH2 and H3K27 methylation might also reflect the 
biological role of EZH2 and the PRC2 complex. In contrast to signalling 
pathways and transcription factors, chromatin-associated proteins and 
epigenetic regulation do not seem to be decisive for lineage choice during differentiation. Instead these proteins are present in the genome to 
ensure transcriptional patterns and cell identity. In other words, the chromatin-associated proteins often fine-tune transcriptional patterns, and 
the genes regulated by the proteins can be both oncogenes and tumour 
suppressor genes. The functions of the chromatin-associated proteins 
do not mean that inhibitors of these proteins will not have a clinical 
benefit, but highlight the difficulty in identifying biomarkers predictive 
of tumour sensitivity. This is illustrated again by the EZH2 inhibitors, 
whereby the levels of EZH2 in a tumour cell line do not predict whether 
the cell line will respond to the inhibitor; however, a weak correlation 
does exist between the ability of EZH2 inhibitors to decrease H3K27me3 
levels in DLBCL and inhibition of cell growth37. 
The generation of small molecule inhibitors of different classes of 
chromatin-associated proteins has not only increased confidence in 
the druggability of many epigenetic modulators, but has also provided 
Figure 4 | Bromodomain proteins and their inhibitors. a, The 
bromodomain can bind acetylated lysines, which are associated with 
actively transcribed promoters. The bromodomain proteins (here 
illustrated by BRD4 and associated proteins) have a variety of functions, 
including mediating the initiation and elongation of transcription. BRD4 
interacts with positive transcription elongation factor b (p-TEFb), which 
phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and 
induces transcriptional elongation. The interaction of BRD4 with a number

strong insights into the rational design of new compounds with higher 
affinity and specificity. The hope is that this knowledge can be translated 
into the generation of specific inhibitors of the many other chromatinassociated proteins involved in cancer. At the very least, such inhibitors 
will be useful as research compounds to understand the biological function of new chromatin-associated proteins, but could eventually also 
allow for the identification and therapeutic targeting of other pathways 
that are important for the cancer phenotype. Increasingly, it is becoming evident that effective, long-term responses to anti-cancer therapies 
require suppression of two or more oncogenic pathways and this is 
likely to be the case for epigenetic therapies as well. However, modulation of the cancer epigenome with specific inhibitors may offer unique 
opportunities to discover effective combination therapies based on the 
potential to directly alter acquired transcriptional resistance mechanisms. Indeed, a recent report85 demonstrating reversal of platinum 
resistance with HDAC inhibition in ovarian cancer highlights such 
opportunities. Undoubtedly, other rational combinations remain to 
be identified and the challenge will be to understand the fundamental 
cellular alterations induced by epigenetic modulators and to develop 
complementary agents that synergize most effectively. Along these lines, 
the resurgence and current success of immunotherapeutic approaches 
to cancer treatment also offers opportunities for epigenetically targeted 
therapeutics. In principle, it may be possible to induce cell surface 
expression of tumour-specific antigens, allowing for more effective and 
sustained immune responses to tumours. Finally, the ability to silence 
crucial oncogenes such as MYC and BCL2 with bromodomain inhibitors has been remarkable and unpredicted. Inactivation of the master 
oncogenic proteins with small molecules has been the holy grail for anticancer approaches for many years. Yet even here, the lack of a detailed 
mechanistic understanding of how the BET inhibitors work has led to 
an empiric approach to determine how best to deploy these agents in the 
clinic. Despite these limitations, it is important to remember that we are 
nonetheless on the verge of advancing new molecules with novel biology to human studies with at least some molecular or pathway basis for 
selecting patients who are most likely to benefit from these agents. Data 
from these studies will ultimately determine whether these new epigenetic therapies will be a meaningful addition to the armamentarium of 
physicians, but the signs are promising. ■
